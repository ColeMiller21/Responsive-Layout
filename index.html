             <p class="bio-content">My name is Cole Miller. I am 27 years old currently residing in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. I graduated high school in 2010 from James Martin High School, where I then joined the United States Army where I served honorably for 5 years as an Infantryman.
                  I made it to the rank of E-5 or Sergeant and was a Fire Team Leader with the oversee of 3-5 men.
                  I got out of the Army in 2015 and moved back to Arlington, where I worked at Costco as a Tire Center Supervisor.
                  Now I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Flex Course at Southern Methodist University where I am looking to make a career change into the software development field.
                  I am looking forward to the class and my future in this new adventure and am awaiting the challenges ahead.
